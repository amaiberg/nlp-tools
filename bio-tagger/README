Simple README

Compiling
----------
1. Set JAVA_HOME environtment variable to java runtime environment
	e.g. JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5/
	     export JAVA_HOME
2. type "build.sh"

that should be all.


Demo
-----

run "bin/runGeneDemo.sh"

should produce two files with the mask samle_output - check them out

Running the tagger
-------------------

./bin/runTagger.sh type model_name text_file output_mask

type = gene or var or mal (for gene or variation or malignancy)
model_name = name of stored model
text_file = input file (plain text or MEDLINE format - see example in data/testing/medline.txt)
output_mask = will create output_mask.html and output_mask.txt (the output files)

output_mask.txt
- MEDLINE style file with a list of entities in the Metadata fields
output_mask.html
- HTML view with entities colored.

There are pretrained gene, variation and malignancy models in the data directory.

Training taggers
------------------

Training data format:

w11	t11
w21	t21
w31	t31
...
wn1	tn1

w12	t12
w22	t22
...

The first column is the token (or word) in the sentence and the second the appropriate
tag (i.e. using the BIO tag set). The columns are tab separated. Documents are separated
by a space. See examples in data/training.

bin/geneTrainer.sh training_data testing_data model_name

e.g. bin/geneTrainer.sh data/training/gene/data/all_9-15-2004_train.txt null data/geneModel.crf

if you do not have testing data, just put type "null" (as in the example)

Training the variation and malignancy tagger is similar

Training data included:

For Genes, the best data is at: data/training/gene/data/gene_train_data
For Variations, the best data is at: data/training/variation/variation_train_data
For Malignancies, the best data is at: data/training/malignancy/malignancy_train_data

Some data directories have a subdirectory called "other" that contains additional data.

Testing on new data
-------------------

Say you have a new annotated set of data (in the same format as the training data)
and you want to measure performance. Then you can type:

bin/geneTestSetEvaluator.sh testing_data model_name

and it will output the performance of the model (i.e. precision/recall/f-measure).

to do my best to answer them.

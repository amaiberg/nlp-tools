A circulating antigen of approximately Mr 33 - 35 kDa with good specifi city and antigenicity , in the plasma of mala rial patients was shown . Heating at 100 degrees C did not destroy its antigenicity . When fractions highly enriched in the 33 - 35 kDa proteins were used in ELISAs , a seroreactivity in plasma obt ained from primary - infected individuals was found . Controls from normal patients were always negative . The antigenic characteristics suggest that it may be included within the group of new described Plasmodium <gene><B><font color=RED>soluble antigens</b></font> </gene> .<BR>Author: de Dominguez N<BR>Published: 2000<BR>Type: Journal Article<BR>Reference: Folia Parasitol (Praha) 2000;47(4):267-72.<BR>
<HR>PMID: 11150536<BR><b>ELISPOT assay for detection of <gene><B><font color=RED>peptide specific interferon-gamma</b></font> </gene> secreting cells in rhesus macaques .</b><BR>A reliable procedure to measure antigen specific T cell responses in rhesus macaques is required to determine the efficacy of vaccines and immunotherapies . The currently available T cell assays are poo rly quantifiable or technically difficult to perform . Classical 51Cr - release cytoto xic T cell ( CTL ) assays are cumbersome and difficult to quantitate reproducibly . Detection of specific T-cell using MHC-peptide tetrameric complexes is highly sensitive , but requires knowledge of MHC type and prior identification of T cell epitopes . We therefore developed a rhesus <gene><B><font color=RED>interferon-gamma</b></font> </gene> ( <gene><B><font color=RED>IFN-gamma</b></font> </gene> ) ELISPOT assay capable of detecting <gene><B><font color=RED>IFN-gamma</b></font> </gene> secretion in response to stimulation with pooled 20 - mer peptides . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) from rhesus monke ys immunized with a DNA vaccine and recombinant canary pox enc oding the Plasmodium knowlesi circumsporozoite protein ( <gene><B><font color=RED>PkCSP</b></font> </gene> ) were incubated with pools of peptides from <gene><B><font color=RED>PkCSP</b></font> </gene> . Positive responses to peptide pools and indi v idual peptides ranging from 100 to 450 spot forming cells ( SFC ) / 10(6) PBMC were detected in four of four immunized monke ys and in zero of two control monkeys . In two monke ys studied in detail , the <gene><B><font color=RED>IFN-gamma</b></font> </gene> response was focussed on a single 20 - <gene><B><font color=RED>mer peptide</b></font> </gene> , <gene><B><font color=RED>QGDGANAGQPQAQGDGANAG</b></font> </gene> , and was dependent on <gene><B><font color=RED>CD4</b></font> </gene> (+ ) , but not <gene><B><font color=RED>CD8</b></font> </gene> ( + ) , T cells . Background responses in control monke ys and preimmunization PBMCs ranged from 10 to 50 SFC / 10(6) PBMC . The average within assay and between assay coefficients of variation ( CV ) for this peptide ELISPOT were 21.9 and 24.7 % , respectively . This peptide <gene><B><font color=RED>IFN-gamma</b></font> </gene> assay will be a useful tool for evaluation of T cell responses in rhesus macaques .<BR>Author: Kumar A<BR>Published: 2001 Jan 1<BR>Type: Journal Article<BR>Reference: J Immunol Methods 2001 Jan 1;247(1-2):49-60.<BR>
<HR>PMID: 11146249<BR><b>The potential utility of the Semi-N ested Multiplex PCR technique for the diagnosis and investigation of congenital mala ria .</b><BR>We report three cases of congenital malaria involving two mala rial immune mothers living in Spain . Diagnostic PCR and Genotyping PCR for merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 were essential to show that mothers and new - borns had different Plasmodium population parasites at the moment of the delivery , and that the infection was acquired earlier in gestation by transplacental transmission . In the first case the Plasmodium species founded in both , mother and child were different . Malaria in the twins showed a mixed infection ( P. falciparum plus P. malariae ) while the mother presented a P. falciparum infection . These facts were confirmed studying the polymorphisms for MSP1 and MSP2 . Blood samples of the newborns were analyzed an half hour after delivery ex cluding the possibility of re - infection by mosquito bite and indicating a vertical transmission during pregnancy .<BR>Author: Rubio JM<BR>Published: 2000 Dec<BR>Type: Case Reports<BR>Reference: Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis 2000 Dec;38(4):233-6.<BR>

As 60A is a single copy gene , approximately 5 kb in length and encodes eight exons . Here we report the isolation and characterization of two of four transcripts produced from this gene . The transcripts As 60A(1)and As 60A(2)encode related 5'UTR / e xon 1 sequences . As 60A is most similar to the 60A genes from Drosophila and is thus a member of the <gene><B><font color=RED>Dpp</b></font> </gene> / <gene><B><font color=RED>BMP</b></font> </gene> subfamily of the <gene><B><font color=RED>TGF-beta</b></font> </gene> superfamily . The splice junction of intron 2 is conserved among As 60A , <gene><B><font color=RED>BMP2</b></font> </gene> , <gene><B><font color=RED>BMP4</b></font> </gene> , <gene><B><font color=RED>Tc-Dpp</b></font> </gene> , <gene><B><font color=RED>Bm- tgh-1</b></font> </gene> , <gene><B><font color=RED>TGF-beta1</b></font> </gene> and <gene><B><font color=RED>Dpp</b></font> </gene> . Intron 2 also contains three putative binding sites for a Dorsal / Gambif1 transcription factor . The large number of introns and the conser vation of intron 2 indicate that As 60A is relati vely anc ient compared to the other arthropod <gene><B><font color=RED>TGF-beta</b></font> </gene> genes . We also propose that As 60A plays a role in the mosquito immune response to Plasmodium infection .<BR>Author: Crampton AL<BR>Published: 2001 Jan 21<BR>Type: Journal Article<BR>Reference: Cytokine 2001 Jan 21;13(2):65-74.<BR>
<HR>PMID: 11145137<BR><b>New potential antimalarial agents : synthesis and biological activities of original diaza-analogs of phenanthrene .</b><BR>Several diaza-analogs of phenanthrene derived from 3-ami no , 5-amino , 6-amino , 8-aminoquinolines , and 5-aminoisoquinoline were prepared to evaluate their antiplasmodial activities . All compounds showed mild to good activitiy in vitro , both on a Nigerian chloroquino - sensitive strain and on the chloroquino - resistant FcB1 -Columbia and FcM29 strains . The position of the intracyclic nitrogen atom is shown to be crucial for the activities ( best results are obt ained with a 1,10 -phenanthroline skeleton ) .

Although preliminary clinical trials with <gene><B><font color=RED>CYP</b></font> </gene> failed to confirm such activity in subjects with natur ally acquired infection with Plasmodium falciparum , Nigerian investigat ors have reported that another antihistaminic , chlorpheniramine , significantly restores the blood schizontocidal action of CQ in semi - immune patients with CQ - resistant P. falciparum , when the two compounds are administered together .

N ucleotide sequences of each variable domain or block of this antigen may be grouped into one of three possible allelic types ( K1 , MAD20 and RO33 ) , and 24 major types of the msp-1 gene may be defined , as unique combinations of allelic types in these variable blocks . Isolates collected from the Brazilian Amazon , over a period of 14 years , have now been investigated , by PCR - based typing of the msp-1 gene . Thirteen of the 24 possible gene - types were identified , and 336 P. falciparum clones were fully typed among 239 isolates . Most parasites ( 87 % ) belonged to one of the seven most frequent gene - types . Marked temporal variation in the distribution of msp-1 variants was found when comparing parasites sampled in the same sites at interva ls of at least 5 years . Spatial variations were also found when comparing parasites from both neighbouring and distant sites within the Amazon Basin . The between - population variance in the frequencies of msp-1 allelic types found in Brazil , as estimated by Wright 's FST statistic , is of similar magnitude to that found in previous world - wide comparisons . The potential implications of these findings for the development of an MSP-1- based , multivalent malaria vaccine are discussed .<BR>Author: Silva NS<BR>Published: 2000 Oct<BR>Type: Journal Article<BR>Reference: Ann Trop Med Parasitol 2000 Oct;94(7):675-88.<BR>
<HR>PMID: 11143543<BR><b>[ Doxycycline -- the forgotten antibiotic ]</b><BR>BACKGROUND : Doxycycline is an broad - spectrum antimicrobial agent , it remains an inexpensive alternative for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections and urin ary tract infections . Despite these clinical data the use of doxycycline has decreased during the last years . PHARMACOLOGY : A dverse effects and resistance to therapy are infrequent and not different to fluoroquinolones and macrolide antibiotics . Gastrointestinal and phototoxic side effects are of importance . After oral administration 75 % will be absorbed and larg ely eliminated by the hepatic and intestinal way . Contraindications are severe liver dysfunction and treatment in childhood . CLINICAL INDICATIONS : Bacterial resistance to doxycycline has a low incidence in Germany . A therapeutic success can be expected in respiratory and urin ary tract infections in about 80 % . Doxycycline is the drug of choice for treating infections caused by Rickettsia , Borrelia , Ehrlichia . It shows good activity against Plasmodium falciparum as one part in a comb i nation therapy . Daily costs of therapy are low , in oral administration DM 0.80 per day , in i.v. administration DM 22,-per day . CONCLUSION : Despite competition from new antibiotics , doxycycline can retain an important place in the treatment of many infectio us diseases .<BR>Author: Ziegler T<BR>Published: 2000 Nov 15<BR>Type: Journal Article<BR>Reference: Med Klin (Munich) 2000 Nov 15;95(11):629-31.<BR>

<HR>PMID: 11141568<BR><b>Migration of Plasmodium sporozoites through cells before infection .</b><BR>Intracellular bacteria and parasites typically invade host cells through the formation of an internalization vacuole around the invading pathogen . Plasmodium sporozoites , the infective stage of the malaria parasite transmitted by mosquitoes , have an alternative mechanism to enter cells . We observed breaching of the plasma membrane of the host cell followed by rapid repair . This mode of entry did not result in the formation of a vacuole around the sporozoite , and was followed by exit of the parasite from the host cell . Sporozoites traversed the cytosol of several cells before invading a hepatocyte by formation of a parasitophorous vacuole , in which they developed into the next infective stage . Sporozoite migration through several cells in the mamm a lian host appears to be essential for the completion of the life cycle .<BR>Author: Mota MM<BR>Published: 2001 Jan 5<BR>Type: Journal Article<BR>Reference: Science 2001 Jan 5;291(5501):141-4.<BR>

In contrast to BALB/c mice , DBA/2 mice developed significantly less parasitemia and never manifested symptoms of cerebral malaria ( CM ) on infection with this parasite . Moreover , the histol og i cal changes evident in the brain of susceptible BALB/c were absent in DBA/2 mice . Interestingly , the resistant DBA/2 mice when treated with recombinant <gene><B><font color=RED>interleukin ( IL )-2</b></font> </gene> , were found to develop CM symptoms and the infection became fatal by 6 to 8 days after infection . This condition was associated with an aug mented <gene><B><font color=RED>interferon-gamma</b></font> </gene> and nitric oxide production . Unexpectedly , <gene><B><font color=RED>IL-10</b></font> </gene> levels were also elevated in IL-2 - treated DBA/2 mice during late stage of infection ( at day 6 of infection ) whereas the inverse relationship between <gene><B><font color=RED>IL-10</b></font> </gene> and <gene><B><font color=RED>interferon-gamma</b></font> </gene> or nitric oxide was maintained in the early stage of infection ( at day 3 after infection ) . The level of <gene><B><font color=RED>tumor necrosis factor -alpha</b></font> </gene> production was moderately increased in the late phase of infection in these mice . Histology of brain from IL-2 - treated mice demonstrated the presence of parasitized erythrocytes and infiltration of lymphocytes in cerebral vessels , and also displayed some signs of endothelial degeneration . Confocal microscop ical studies demonstrated preferential accumulation of gammadelta T cells in the cerebral vesse ls of IL-2 - treated and - i nfected mice but not in mice treated with <gene><B><font color=RED>IL-2</b></font> </gene> alone . The cells recruited in the brain were activated because they demonstrated expression of <gene><B><font color=RED>CD25</b></font> </gene> ( <gene><B><font color=RED>IL-2R</b></font> </gene> ) and <gene><B><font color=RED>CD54</b></font> </gene> ( intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ) molecules .

Compound 7b demonstrated excellent in vivo antimalarial potency with an ED(50 ) of 2.12 mg / kg (cf. artemether = 6 mg / kg ) versus P. berghei .

<HR>PMID: 11140853<BR><b>Malaria blood - stage infection and its control by the immune system .</b><BR>Malaria is caused by the protozoon Plasmodium , transmitted to humans by Anopheles mosquitoes . The most dangerous of the plasmodia infe cting humans is Plasmodium falciparum . The disease is caused by those parasite stages which multiply asexu ally in red blood cells . In non - immune individuals , P. falciparum may cause severe and life -threatening disease . Another risk group is constituted by pregnant women , particul a rly during their first pregnancies . Immunity to malaria usually requires repeated exposure to the parasite to become long lasting . One reason for this is the capa city of the parasite to vary the antigens which are major targets for protective <gene><B><font color=RED>antibodies . Antibody</b></font> </gene> - dependent protection is primarily mediated by cytophilic IgG <gene><B><font color=RED>antibodies</b></font> </gene> activating cytoto xic and phag ocytic effector functions of neutrophils and monocytes . Malaria infection also involves elevated production of <gene><B><font color=RED>IgE antibodies</b></font> </gene> . However , <gene><B><font color=RED>IgE</b></font> </gene> - containing immune complexes are pathogenic rather than protective by crosslinking <gene><B><font color=RED>IgE receptors</b></font> </gene> ( <gene><B><font color=RED>CD23</b></font> </gene> ) on monocytes , leading to local overproduction of <gene><B><font color=RED>TNF</b></font> </gene> , a major pathogenic factor in this disease . T cells are essential for both acquisition and regulation of malaria immunity . The major T cells controlling blood stage infections are <gene><B><font color=RED>CD4</b></font> </gene> + of both the Thl and Th2 subsets . However , T cells carrying the <gene><B><font color=RED>gamma6 receptor</b></font> </gene> also contribute to this control . The balance between the <gene><B><font color=RED>cytokines</b></font> </gene> produced by different cell types is critical for the course of infection , with <gene><B><font color=RED>IFN-gamma</b></font> </gene> having a key role in anti - malaria defence . Blood - stage infections are also under complex genetic control . Among the regu latory genes , those involved in elevated production of <gene><B><font color=RED>TNF</b></font> </gene> are associated with increased risk of severe disease and death due to P. falciparum infection .<BR>Author: Perlmann P<BR>Published: 2000<BR>Type: Journal Article<BR>Reference: Folia Biol (Praha) 2000;46(6):210-8.<BR>

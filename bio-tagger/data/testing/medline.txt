      soluble antigens from infected patient plasma, Western blotting, thermal
      stability and ELISA assays using hyperimmune IgG-antimalaria antibodies
      was the main objective of this work. A circulating antigen of
      approximately Mr 33-35 kDa with good specificity and antigenicity, in the
      plasma of malarial patients was shown. Heating at 100 degrees C did not
      destroy its antigenicity. When fractions highly enriched in the 33-35 kDa
      proteins were used in ELISAs, a seroreactivity in plasma obtained from
      primary-infected individuals was found. Controls from normal patients were
      always negative. The antigenic characteristics suggest that it may be
      included within the group of new described Plasmodium soluble antigens.

TI  - ELISPOT assay for detection of peptide specific interferon-gamma secreting
      cells in rhesus macaques.
PG  - 49-60
AB  - A reliable procedure to measure antigen specific T cell responses in
      rhesus macaques is required to determine the efficacy of vaccines and
      immunotherapies. The currently available T cell assays are poorly
      quantifiable or technically difficult to perform. Classical 51Cr-release
      cytotoxic T cell (CTL) assays are cumbersome and difficult to quantitate
      reproducibly. Detection of specific T-cell using MHC-peptide tetrameric
      complexes is highly sensitive, but requires knowledge of MHC type and
      prior identification of T cell epitopes. We therefore developed a rhesus
      interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) ELISPOT assay capable of detecting IFN-gamma
      secretion in response to stimulation with pooled 20-mer peptides.
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from rhesus monkeys immunized
      with a DNA vaccine and recombinant canary pox encoding the Plasmodium
      knowlesi circumsporozoite protein (PkCSP) were incubated with pools of
      peptides from PkCSP. Positive responses to peptide pools and individual
      peptides ranging from 100 to 450 spot forming cells (SFC)/10(6) PBMC were
      detected in four of four immunized monkeys and in zero of two control
      monkeys. In two monkeys studied in detail, the IFN-gamma response was
      focussed on a single 20-mer peptide, QGDGANAGQPQAQGDGANAG, and was
      dependent on CD4(+), but not CD8(+), T cells. Background responses in
      control monkeys and preimmunization PBMCs ranged from 10 to 50 SFC/10(6)
      PBMC. The average within assay and between assay coefficients of variation
      (CV) for this peptide ELISPOT were 21.9 and 24.7%, respectively. This
      peptide IFN-gamma assay will be a useful tool for evaluation of T cell
      responses in rhesus macaques.

PG  - 233-6
AB  - We report three cases of congenital malaria involving two malarial immune
      mothers living in Spain. Diagnostic PCR and Genotyping PCR for merozoite
      surface proteins 1 and 2 were essential to show that mothers and new-borns
      had different Plasmodium population parasites at the moment of the
      delivery, and that the infection was acquired earlier in gestation by
      transplacental transmission. In the first case the Plasmodium species
      founded in both, mother and child were different. Malaria in the twins
      showed a mixed infection (P. falciparum plus P. malariae) while the mother
      presented a P. falciparum infection. These facts were confirmed studying
      the polymorphisms for MSP1 and MSP2. Blood samples of the newborns were
      analyzed an half hour after delivery excluding the possibility of
      re-infection by mosquito bite and indicating a vertical transmission
      during pregnancy.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of As60A, a transforming growth factor-beta
      gene, from the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 65-74
AB  - We have isolated the first mosquito member of the TGF-beta superfamily,
      As60A. As60A is a single copy gene, approximately 5 kb in length and
      encodes eight exons. Here we report the isolation and characterization of
      two of four transcripts produced from this gene. The transcripts
      As60A(1)and As60A(2)encode related 5'UTR/exon 1 sequences. As60A is most
      similar to the 60A genes from Drosophila and is thus a member of the
      Dpp/BMP subfamily of the TGF-beta superfamily. The splice junction of
      intron 2 is conserved among As60A, BMP2, BMP4, Tc-Dpp, Bm-tgh-1, TGF-beta1
      and Dpp. Intron 2 also contains three putative binding sites for a
      Dorsal/Gambif1 transcription factor. The large number of introns and the
      conservation of intron 2 indicate that As60A is relatively ancient
      compared to the other arthropod TGF-beta genes. We also propose that As60A
      plays a role in the mosquito immune response to Plasmodium infection.

TI  - New potential antimalarial agents: synthesis and biological activities of
      original diaza-analogs of phenanthrene.
PG  - 1886-9
AB  - Several diaza-analogs of phenanthrene derived from 3-amino, 5-amino,
      6-amino, 8-aminoquinolines, and 5-aminoisoquinoline were prepared to
      evaluate their antiplasmodial activities. All compounds showed mild to
      good activitiy in vitro, both on a Nigerian chloroquino-sensitive strain
      and on the chloroquino-resistant FcB1-Columbia and FcM29 strains. The
      position of the intracyclic nitrogen atom is shown to be crucial for the
      activities (best results are obtained with a 1,10-phenanthroline
      skeleton). In regard to the particular properties of this structure
      (metalloprotease inhibition activitiy by chelating divalent metal ions),
      the potential chelating site of the molecule was blocked. In this case,
      the biological activity of the compound was greatly enhanced, showing that
      the mechanism of action of such a compound is probably not correlated to
      metalloprotease inhibition activity.

TI  - The chemotherapy of rodent malaria. LIX. Drug combinations to impede the
      selection of drug resistance, Part 3: Observations on cyproheptadine, an
      antihistaminic agent, with chloroquine.
PG  - 689-97
AB  - Several compounds in current clinical use as antihistaminic agents, among
      them cyproheptadine (CYP), have been shown, in experimental models, to
      reverse resistance of the asexual, intra-erythrocytic stages of rodent or
      human malarial parasites to chloroquine (CQ). Although preliminary
      clinical trials with CYP failed to confirm such activity in subjects with
      naturally acquired infection with Plasmodium falciparum, Nigerian
      investigators have reported that another antihistaminic, chlorpheniramine,
      significantly restores the blood schizontocidal action of CQ in
      semi-immune patients with CQ-resistant P. falciparum, when the two
      compounds are administered together. The rates at which resistance to CYP
      can be produced, in mice infected either with CQ-resistant P. yoelii ssp.
      NS or CQ-resistant P. yoelii nigeriensis, when drug-selection pressure is
      exerted with this compound alone have now been compared with the rate and
      extent to which resistance develops in infected animals that are treated
      with various combinations of CYP and CQ. The data indicate that, in both
      parasites, stable resistance develops slowly to CYP alone and that
      exposure to a combination of CYP plus CQ significantly impedes the
      selection of resistance to CYP. Although the antimalarial action of CYP is
      reported to extend to the pre-erythrocytic hepatic stages, there was no
      evidence of gametocytocidal activity in the present study. The future
      implications of these observations are discussed in relation to the
      clinical potential of CYP + CQ and similar combinations and possible
      future research.

TI  - Temporal and spatial distribution of the variants of merozoite surface
      protein-1 (MSP-1) in Plasmodium falciparum populations in Brazil.
PG  - 675-88
AB  - The polymorphic, merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) of Plasmodium
      falciparum, an antigen of the parasite's asexual blood-stages, is a major
      malaria-vaccine candidate. Nucleotide sequences of each variable domain or
      block of this antigen may be grouped into one of three possible allelic
      types (K1, MAD20 and RO33), and 24 major types of the msp-1 gene may be
      defined, as unique combinations of allelic types in these variable blocks.
      Isolates collected from the Brazilian Amazon, over a period of 14 years,
      have now been investigated, by PCR-based typing of the msp-1 gene.
      Thirteen of the 24 possible gene-types were identified, and 336 P.
      falciparum clones were fully typed among 239 isolates. Most parasites
      (87%) belonged to one of the seven most frequent gene-types. Marked
      temporal variation in the distribution of msp-1 variants was found when
      comparing parasites sampled in the same sites at intervals of at least 5
      years. Spatial variations were also found when comparing parasites from
      both neighbouring and distant sites within the Amazon Basin. The
      between-population variance in the frequencies of msp-1 allelic types
      found in Brazil, as estimated by Wright's FST statistic, is of similar
      magnitude to that found in previous world-wide comparisons. The potential
      implications of these findings for the development of an MSP-1-based,
      multivalent malaria vaccine are discussed.

TI  - [Doxycycline--the forgotten antibiotic]
PG  - 629-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Doxycycline is an broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, it
      remains an inexpensive alternative for the treatment of community-acquired
      respiratory infections and urinary tract infections. Despite these
      clinical data the use of doxycycline has decreased during the last years.
      PHARMACOLOGY: Adverse effects and resistance to therapy are infrequent and
      not different to fluoroquinolones and macrolide antibiotics.
      Gastrointestinal and phototoxic side effects are of importance. After oral
      administration 75% will be absorbed and largely eliminated by the hepatic
      and intestinal way. Contraindications are severe liver dysfunction and
      treatment in childhood. CLINICAL INDICATIONS: Bacterial resistance to
      doxycycline has a low incidence in Germany. A therapeutic success can be
      expected in respiratory and urinary tract infections in about 80%.
      Doxycycline is the drug of choice for treating infections caused by
      Rickettsia, Borrelia, Ehrlichia. It shows good activity against Plasmodium
      falciparum as one part in a combination therapy. Daily costs of therapy

TI  - Infection associated hemophagocytic syndrome: a report of 50 children.
PG  - 1141-9
AB  - Fifty children were diagnosed with infection associated hemophagocytic
      syndrome (IAHS) over the 10 year period from January 1988 through December
      1997 at Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, Thailand. Their
      ages ranged from 2 months to 14 years (mean 4.14 years). There was no
      difference in sex. Bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, fungal and protozoa
      were the associated infections in some of these patients. Supportive with
      specific therapy for the underlying disease was administered aggressively
      in all patients. Intravenous immuneglobulin (IVIG) was given in 8
      patients. Thirty-five patients (70%) died, mostly as a result of
      coagulopathy with multiple organ failure and opportunistic infections. Two
      patients developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia 25 days and 3 months after
      recovering from IAHS.

TI  - Migration of Plasmodium sporozoites through cells before infection.
PG  - 141-4
AB  - Intracellular bacteria and parasites typically invade host cells through
      the formation of an internalization vacuole around the invading pathogen.
      Plasmodium sporozoites, the infective stage of the malaria parasite
      transmitted by mosquitoes, have an alternative mechanism to enter cells.
      We observed breaching of the plasma membrane of the host cell followed by
      rapid repair. This mode of entry did not result in the formation of a
      vacuole around the sporozoite, and was followed by exit of the parasite
      from the host cell. Sporozoites traversed the cytosol of several cells
      before invading a hepatocyte by formation of a parasitophorous vacuole, in
      which they developed into the next infective stage. Sporozoite migration
      through several cells in the mammalian host appears to be essential for
      the completion of the life cycle.

TI  - Cerebral malaria in mice: interleukin-2 treatment induces accumulation of
      gammadelta T cells in the brain and alters resistant mice to
      susceptible-like phenotype.
PG  - 163-72
AB  - In this study, we report that infection with Plasmodium yoelii 17XL, a
      lethal strain of rodent malaria, does not result in death in the DBA/2
      strain of mice. In contrast to BALB/c mice, DBA/2 mice developed
      significantly less parasitemia and never manifested symptoms of cerebral
      malaria (CM) on infection with this parasite. Moreover, the histological
      changes evident in the brain of susceptible BALB/c were absent in DBA/2
      mice. Interestingly, the resistant DBA/2 mice when treated with
      recombinant interleukin (IL)-2, were found to develop CM symptoms and the
      infection became fatal by 6 to 8 days after infection. This condition was
      associated with an augmented interferon-gamma and nitric oxide production.
      Unexpectedly, IL-10 levels were also elevated in IL-2-treated DBA/2 mice
      during late stage of infection (at day 6 of infection) whereas the inverse
      relationship between IL-10 and interferon-gamma or nitric oxide was
      maintained in the early stage of infection (at day 3 after infection). The
      level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha production was moderately increased
      in the late phase of infection in these mice. Histology of brain from
      IL-2-treated mice demonstrated the presence of parasitized erythrocytes
      and infiltration of lymphocytes in cerebral vessels, and also displayed
      some signs of endothelial degeneration. Confocal microscopical studies
      demonstrated preferential accumulation of gammadelta T cells in the
      cerebral vessels of IL-2-treated and -infected mice but not in mice
      treated with IL-2 alone. The cells recruited in the brain were activated
      because they demonstrated expression of CD25 (IL-2R) and CD54
      (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) molecules. Administration of
      anti-gammadelta mAb prevented development of CM in IL-2-treated mice until
      day 18 after infection whereas mice treated with control antibody showed
      CM symptoms by day 6 after infection. The information concerning creating
      pathological sequelae and death in an otherwise resistant mouse strain
      provides an interesting focus for the burden of pathological attributes on
      death in an infectious disease.

PG  - 1638-40
AB  - Twenty-one alkaloids have been assessed for activities against Plasmodium
      falciparum (multidrug- resistant strain K1) in vitro; 18 of these are
      reported for the first time. Two protoberberine alkaloids,
      dehydrodiscretine and berberine, were found to have antiplasmodial IC(50)
      values less than 1 M, while seven alkaloids-allocrytopine, columbamine,
      dehydroocoteine, jatrorrhizine, norcorydine, thalifendine, and
      ushinsunine-had values between 1 and 10 M. These results are discussed in
      the context of structure-activity relationships. Compounds were also
      assessed for antiamoebic and cytotoxic activities, but none was
      significantly active except for berberine, which was moderately cytotoxic.

TI  - Synthesis, antimalarial activity, biomimetic iron(II) chemistry, and in
      vivo metabolism of novel, potent C-10-phenoxy derivatives of
      dihydroartemisinin.
PG  - 58-68
AB  - The combination of TMSOTf and AgClO(4) promotes the efficient
      C-10-phenoxylation of dihydroartemisinin (3) in good chemical yield and
      excellent stereoselectivity. All of the new phenoxy derivatives have
      potent in vitro antimalarial activity. On the basis of the excellent yield
      and stereoselectivity obtained for the p-trifluoromethyl derivative 7b,
      this compound and the parent phenyl-substituted derivative 5b were
      selected for in vivo biological evaluation against Plasmodium berghei in
      the mouse model and for metabolism studies in rats. Compound 7b
      demonstrated excellent in vivo antimalarial potency with an ED(50) of 2.12
      mg/kg (cf. artemether = 6 mg/kg) versus P. berghei. Furthermore, from
      preliminary metabolism studies, this compound was not metabolized to
      dihydroartemisinin; suggesting it should have a longer half-life and
      potentially lower toxicity than the first-generation derivatives
      artemether and arteether. From biomimetic Fe(II)-catalyzed decomposition
      studies and ESR spectroscopy, the mechanism of action of these new lead
      antimalarials is proposed to involve the formation of both primary and
      secondary C-centered cytotoxic radicals which presumably react with vital
      parasite thiol-containing cellular macromolecules.

TI  - Malaria blood-stage infection and its control by the immune system.
PG  - 210-8
AB  - Malaria is caused by the protozoon Plasmodium, transmitted to humans by
      Anopheles mosquitoes. The most dangerous of the plasmodia infecting humans
      is Plasmodium falciparum. The disease is caused by those parasite stages
      which multiply asexually in red blood cells. In non-immune individuals, P.
      falciparum may cause severe and life-threatening disease. Another risk
      group is constituted by pregnant women, particularly during their first
      pregnancies. Immunity to malaria usually requires repeated exposure to the
      parasite to become long lasting. One reason for this is the capacity of
      the parasite to vary the antigens which are major targets for protective
      antibodies. Antibody-dependent protection is primarily mediated by
      cytophilic IgG antibodies activating cytotoxic and phagocytic effector
      functions of neutrophils and monocytes. Malaria infection also involves
      elevated production of IgE antibodies. However, IgE-containing immune
      complexes are pathogenic rather than protective by crosslinking IgE
      receptors (CD23) on monocytes, leading to local overproduction of TNF, a
      major pathogenic factor in this disease. T cells are essential for both
      acquisition and regulation of malaria immunity. The major T cells
      controlling blood stage infections are CD4+ of both the Thl and Th2
      subsets. However, T cells carrying the gamma6 receptor also contribute to
      this control. The balance between the cytokines produced by different cell
      types is critical for the course of infection, with IFN-gamma having a key
      role in anti-malaria defence. Blood-stage infections are also under
      complex genetic control. Among the regulatory genes, those involved in
      elevated production of TNF are associated with increased risk of severe
      disease and death due to P. falciparum infection.

TI  - Naturally acquired antibody responses to the C-terminal region of

PG  - 14-20
AB  - We expressed a protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to evaluate
      the humoral immune responses to the C-terminal region of the merozoite
      surface protein 1 of Plasmodium vivax. This protein (Pv200(18)) had a
      molecular mass of 18 kDa and was reactive with the sera of individuals
      with patent vivax malaria on immunoblotting analysis. The levels of
      immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies against Pv200(18) were measured
      in 421 patients with vivax malaria (patient group), 528 healthy
      individuals from areas of nonendemicity (control group 1), and 470 healthy
      individuals from areas of endemicity (control group 2), using the indirect
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. To study the longevity
      of the antibodies, 20 subjects from the patient group were also tested for
      the antibody levels once a month for 1 year. When the cutoff values for
      seropositivity were determined as the mean + 3 x standard deviation of the
      antibody levels in control group 1, both IgG and IgM antibody levels were
      negative in 98.5% (465 of 472) of control group 2. The IgG and IgM
      antibodies were positive in 88.1% (371 of 421) and 94.5% (398 of 421) of
      the patient group, respectively. The IgM antibody became negative 2 to 4
      months after the onset of symptoms, whereas the IgG antibody usually
      remained positive for more than 5 months. In conclusion, indirect ELISA
      using Pv200(18) expressed in S. cerevisiae may be a useful diagnostic
      method for vivax malaria.
